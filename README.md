# Create a test dataset given a set of probabilities


Predict: probability of remittance (MADRS <10 = no depressive symptoms) of depressive episode

Without knowledge about the participant the prob. of remission rate is 50% (given some time period).

Variables of interest:

Sex (no change in prob. of remission )
Age (positive correlation, the older the more probable is remission)
Psychotic episodes (yes or no variable about ongoing episodes, if yes higher prob. of remission)
MADRS scores (0…10 = normal, 10 .. 19 mild depression, 20 .. 34 moderate depression, 35 .. 60 severe depression, the higher the depression score the higher the prob. of remission)
Duration of current episode (shorter episodes the higher the probability of remission)
